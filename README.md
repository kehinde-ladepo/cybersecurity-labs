# Cybersecurity Labs

This repository documents cybersecurity labs and concepts I’ve worked on, including:

- SIEM monitoring (Splunk, Azure Sentinel)  
- Detecting brute-force and suspicious login activity  
- Investigating Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)  
- Vulnerability analysis and remediation  
- System hardening using security best practices and CIS Benchmarks  

These labs strengthen my skills in threat detection, response, and securing enterprise environments.
